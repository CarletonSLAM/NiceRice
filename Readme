# Vikram & Hao
Nice Rice Platformer

This project was made at SLAM (http://staylateandmake.ca/)

## Inspiration
This project evolved from a real life pokemon game into a simple platformer due to time constraintes.

## What it does
You are a simple rice farmer trying to get wild animas out of your fields. Jump around get as far as possible without being eatten.

## How we built it
This game runs on pygame, where the code is structured for scalability.

## Challenges we ran into
Many challenges were met during this project which included; changing projects due to defective hardware and using pygame for the first time

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The main accomplishment was finishing a functioning protype of the application which can be used to search Kijiji as is. Other accomplishments include using javascript for the first time, setting up the interface and layout, and also setting up the server end of the project. 

## What we learned
We learned how to use pygame in a very accelerated manner, we also learned about the drawbacks of using object oriented programming without a clear undertanding of the final structure of the project in mind.

## What's next for NiceRice
The game has almost all functionality completed however the AI for the enemies needs to be developed also a end game needs to be built.
