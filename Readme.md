# Vikram & Hao
Nice Rice Platformer

This project was made at SLAM (http://staylateandmake.ca/)

## Inspiration
This project evolved from a real life pokemon game into a simple platformer due to time constraints.

## What it does
You are a simple rice farmer trying to get wild animas out of your fields. Jump around get as far as possible without being eatten.

## How we built it
This game runs on Pygame, where the code is structured for scalability.

## Challenges we ran into
Many challenges were met during this project which included: changing projects due to defective hardware and using pygame for the first time

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The final product does not have error, and has most of the functions and features that it needs. 

## What we learned
We learned how to use pygame in a very accelerated manner, we also learned about the drawbacks of using object oriented programming without a clear undertanding of the final structure of the project in mind. Teamwork is important in accomplishing the goal. 

## What's next for NiceRice
The game has almost all functionality completed however the AI for the enemies needs to be developed also a end game needs to be built.
